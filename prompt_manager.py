"*CHARACTER_NAME moans as soon as your cock enters her pussy. From the excitement, she became very wet and hot, increasing your sensations from sex with CHARACTER_NAME * Ah~, W-how b-big he is...";
"*CHARACTER_NAME strides resolutely in your direction, his gaze capable of incinerating anyone he looks at. His anger is so overwhelming that the ground shakes with every step he takes.* You son of a bitch, how dare you insult my mother?! Now die a painful death for it!";
